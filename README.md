## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**CogentMentat/CogentMentat** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Heyo, I am a PhD at NYU Abu Dhabi!

In the past: I helped [smash particles together](https://cogentmentat.github.io/projects/p1-FVTX/).

In the future: I will smash data analysis together with text and music to measure cultural innovation.
